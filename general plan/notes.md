Okay given the goal:

  It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 
  
Our business question would be:

  **"How can we accurately predict the sale price of a house based on its characteristics to support smarter property valuation and investment decisions?"**

What are somethings that impact a homes price?

**Location & Neighborhood**

1. Proximity to amenities: Homes near schools, parks, shopping centers, and public transportation often command higher prices.
2. Neighborhood quality: Safety, cleanliness, and overall appeal of a neighborhood can significantly impact property values.
3. School districts: Properties in reputable school districts tend to be more valuable.

**Property Characteristics**

1. Size and layout: Larger homes with functional layouts are typically more desirable.
2. Age and condition: Newer homes or well-maintained older homes usually fetch higher prices.
3. Upgrades and renovations: Modern kitchens, bathrooms, and energy-efficient features can add value.

**Economic Indicators**

1. Interest rates: Lower mortgage rates can increase buyer affordability, driving up demand and prices.
2. Employment rates: Higher employment levels often correlate with increased housing demand.
3. Inflation and economic growth: General economic health influences buyer confidence and purchasing power.

**Market Dynamics**

1. Supply and demand: Limited housing supply with high demand leads to price increases.
2. Comparable sales (comps): Recent sale prices of similar properties in the area set benchmarks for pricing.
3. Time on market: Properties that linger on the market may indicate overpricing or less desirable features.

2. Zoning laws: Regulations can limit or enhance property development, influencing values.
3. Subsidies and incentives: First-time homebuyer programs or tax credits can stimulate demand.

**Environmental Factors**

2. Environmental amenities: Proximity to green spaces or waterfronts can increase property values.
3. Pollution levels: High pollution can negatively impact desirability and prices.
