### Business Problem
Okay given the goal:

  It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 
  
Our business question would be:

  **"How can we accurately predict the sale price of a house based on its characteristics to support smarter property valuation and investment decisions?"**

  What are somethings that impact a homes price?
